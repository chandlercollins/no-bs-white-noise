- Download rate: 2% of impressions = 200 downloads

#### Price Point Comparison

| Price | Apple Cut (30%) | Your Revenue | Downloads (45% conversion) | Total Revenue | Revenue/Download |
|-------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| $0.99 | $0.29 | $0.70 | 90 | $63 | $0.70 |
| $1.99 | $0.60 | $1.39 | 90 | $125 | $1.39 |
| **$2.99** | **$0.90** | **$2.09** | **90** | **$188** | **$2.09** |
| $3.99 | $1.20 | $2.79 | 81 (-10% conv.) | $226 | $2.79 |
| $4.99 | $1.50 | $3.49 | 72 (-20% conv.) | $251 | $3.49 |
