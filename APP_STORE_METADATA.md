• Dynamic reflections with specular highlights
• Fluid spring-based animations with perfect damping
• Multi-layer shadows and gradients for dimensional UI
• Seamless morphing between light, dark, and system modes

**WHY IT EXISTS**

This app harkens back to a time when software could be built for a single purpose and be fast, simple, and lightweight. Inspired by Craig Mod's philosophy on fast software, it prioritizes speed and simplicity over feature bloat.

No tracking. No analytics. No ads. No BS. Just one fair price.
